# Neural Network from Scratch for MNIST Digit Classification

This project implements a neural network in Python using numpy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to understand the fundamental workings of neural networks by building one without relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
